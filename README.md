## Data used in [Tilakaratna and Bensasson](http://www.g3journal.org/content/7/9/2919)

### CEN1.tree to CEN16.tree

These are 16 neighbour joining F84 distance trees in Newick format: one for each of 16 centromere loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The bootstrap values shown are from a total of 10,000 bootstraps, and trees are unrooted. The 80 S. cerevisiae strains shown in each tree were completely homozygous and are fully described in Table S1 of Tilakaratna and Bensasson.
